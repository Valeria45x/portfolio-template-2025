## Why No Build Tools?

Professor feedback: Build tools (Vite, Webpack) are fullstack content, not needed for frontend fundamentals course. Focus on core web technologies.

## Next Steps (Sprint 2)
- Connect to GitHub repository
- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Add more content sections
- Implement animations
- Add project cards with real content
